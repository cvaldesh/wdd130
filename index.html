        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Carlos and I'm currently studying web development. 
        I'm excited to learn more about HTML, CSS, and building websites. 
        I work in the supply chain industry and I am looking to add more technology to my current stack. 
        I am a big anime fan and also a TCG enthusiast. 
        In my spare time, I like to play Pokemon TCG Online, Yu-Gi-Oh, have not tried Magic The Gathering yet because is out of my budget. 
        I also do some Crossfit every now and then, my goal right now is three times a week. 
        I am glad to be here and I hope we can have a great time learning!</p>

        <p>Santiago is the capital of Chile. Is the hub for technology, medicine, commerce, and some other things. The city has great movilization trough public transportation. Traffic jams are normal here, and is also a loud place, so as everywhere there are cons and pros.</p>
