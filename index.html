        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Carlos and I'm currently studying web development. 
        I'm excited to learn more about HTML, CSS, and building websites. 
        I work in the supply chain industry and I am looking to add more technology to my current stack. 
        I am a big anime fan and also a TCG enthusiast. 
        In my spare time, I like to play Pokemon TCG Online, Yu-Gi-Oh, have not tried Magic The Gathering yet because is out of my budget. 
        I also do some Crossfit every now and then, my goal right now is three times a week. 
        I am glad to be here and I hope we can have a great time learning!</p>
